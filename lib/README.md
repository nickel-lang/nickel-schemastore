# json-schema-to-nickel

This library is just a vendored version of the same `lib` directory of
[json-schema-to-nickel](https://github.com/nickel-lang/json-schema-to-nickel/).
In a very near future, we'll rather put it on nickel-mine and use a central
version. This is just a work-around for the first release of nickel-schemastore.
