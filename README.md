# Nickel schemastore

Schemastore is a Nickel library containing contracts automatically generated
from the [schemastore](https://schemastore.org/json/)'s using
[json-schema-to-nickel](https://github.com/nickel-lang/json-schema-to-nickel/).
It is distributed through the (currently experimental) Nickel package manager.

## Usage

TODO

## Updating the contract

The contracts as well as the main entry point `main.ncl` are generated by the
`extract-schemas.py`. Use `nix develop` to enter a shell with the required
environment set up and run `python extract-schemas.py` to regenerate the
contracts.
